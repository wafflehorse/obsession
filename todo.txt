[x] Update RenderQuad struct to remove Rect
[x] Add basic tilemap
[x] Create a base resolution in the game and allow for window resizing that scales quads to the right resolution
[x] Figure out how pixels_per_units actually scales things up and down as screen size changes
	- right now we set the camera size once based on pixels per unit, but we don't update it. We also only set the projection matrix once.
	- So how is tilemap scaling up?
	- And what's interesting, is our ui gets updated with the new pixels per unit each frame and the text seems to stay the same size
	- Revelation: Projection matrix maps our world coordinates to the ndc coords [-1, 1], the viewport stretches those coords to our screen size. 
		- what this means, we set projection and camera once. Then, our internal world units will always scale up correctly with the screen size increasing as long as we update the viewport. 
		- So, we currently have an issue because we update pixels per unit every frame based on the viewport (based on the screen size), but really, the game should never be thinking about pixels per unit really. It should be used to set the camera size, which sets the projection matrix and then scaling happens automatically by the viewport. 

[x] Remove pixels per unit from ui.cpp (viewport should handle the scaling)
	- Although, with fonts, we might be able to cheat a bit and use smaller fonts than our simulated resolution?
[x] Remove screen_size from camera size. Camera size should be based on base resolution

[x] Add gamepad support
[x] Get LSP working for gd and autocorrect
[x] Get entity management working, lookups, ids, etc.
	- What if we free an entity in the entity loop, which causes us to move the last entity to that position,
	which would mean that entity would not get updated?
		- What if we instead had the loop operate on ids? Would that change anything?
[x] Add z_indexing to render groups and entities

[x] Add collision to blocks
	[x] Add block entity
[x] Add z value for representing how far off the ground something is. Like the player gun
[x] Update z-index based on entity y position (player should render correctly in front of and behind blocks)
[x] Fix player collision with warrior so that they don't stick to one another (they exceed collision attempts so they don't end up moving normally)
[x] Add generic entity movement animation update function
[x] Add food
	- This could be some of the animals in the sprite pack?

[x] Add entity item drop velocity and gravity so that it shoots out of entity
[x] Add dead AI state
	[x] Fix warrior animation (stop velocity)
[x] Add boar death animation
	- Can take hunter death animation and remove the hunter on the animal
[x] Add absolute positioning option to elements
[x] Add stacking in hot bar
[x] Add rendering of non-persisted active item
[x] Add handling for when hot bar is full (items don't pull towards player and player doesn't end up picking them up)
[x] Add window on game_memory containing both logical window size and pixel window size
    - this fixes window resizing to work correctly.
[x] Adds animation play flag that allows animation to override a locked animation
    - Fixes warrior not showing death animation when killed in attack animation
[x] Allow non-integer font scaling.
    - This is a little bit of a hack to get text small enough for ui elements like stack size
    - It looks good enough for now
[x] Support dropping stacks
[x] Support picking up stacks
[x] Put generated bitmaps in separate directory so that it can be removed and regenerated without wiping other bitmaps
[x] Fix ore aseprite file uses anim stuff since it breaks them into frames
	- Add maybe _frames.aseprite file handling that treates it as a sprite sheet 
[x] Fix issue where AI entities collide with blocker causing them to be stuck in the wandering state
	- Since they can never reach their target, they stay stuck there
	- With path finding this will be less of an issue, but what if we choose a wander target that is out of bounds or within a blocking entity
		- We probably want some sort of check that the wander target is valid? That might be expensive?
	- Another issue this had me notice was that the animation will be the idle animation since it's not moving
		- And I wonder if that means it's better to have the animation state based on the AI_STATE and we can flip based on velocity?
	- I just added a timer so they don't get stuck
[x] Make animation based on AI state rather than velocity
[x] Simplify animation logic by forcing all animations with a direction to face left
[x] Add player health UI
[x] Fix player damage from warrior
	- hitbox collides on every frame
	- Can maybe solve this by assigning the attack an id (entities can have an attack_id) and use the same collision rule hash
	- Can decide on MAX_ATTACK_IDS which just have to be greater than the max entity id
[x] Pull entity code into entity.cpp
[x] Make player animations based on intention rather than velocity

[x] Add ability to save world init entities to new file
	- probably want this to update the default world_init file path in game.init as well
[x] Add toggle for entity palette that edits whether tilemap is being editted vs. just spawning an entity
- Is tilemap accurate? Or should it be called something else?

[] Differentiate between placed items and non-placed items
	- If a chest isn't placed like after you destroy it and it becomes an item, it should be clear
	and player should be able to pick it up
	- I think we want a floating animation for this
[] Allow for player to click inventory screen without shooting or taking another world action
	- Probably want to disable world input when in the inventory screen? Maybe?
[] Implement chest logic and UI
	[x] Place chest in the world
		[x] Placement UI
		[x] Placement input
	[] Open chest when in proximity with input key
		- Note: chest should close if player walks out of proximity or hits the input key again
	[] Display chest UI showing contents
		- Note: I think we need a somewhat generic way of handling inventory that can be shared
		between hotbar, player_inventory, chests, etc.
	[] Move items from chest to hotbar and vice versa
	[] Add ability to pick up a chest that has been placed
[] Automate food supply
	[x] Add some sort of foragable food entity
	[x] Add ability to pick up food items
	[x] Add food storage box
	[] Add food gathering robot
	[] Add hunger to player

[] Fix collision tunneling 
[] Projectile collider seems off
[] Add items to pre-existing entity stack if exists in hotbar
	- Right now the hotbar just looks for the first available slot and fills it
[] Randomly spawn enemies around the map
[] Add item consumption
[] Add mech entity
[] Add mech AI
	- How should the player control the mech?
[] Add warrior aggro when shot
[] Add workbench

[] Add mouse_world_position to game state
[] Add centering to container elements (centering children)
[] Add support for sprite scaling
[] Add boar sleeping
[] Add ground pivots to spritesheet aseprite file types (non animation)
	- Can hopefully use the pivot value on the same slices that define the bitmap
	- Then we just need to add the parsing of sprite sheet aseprite json files to pack.cpp
[] Add pathfinding to player when in range
[] Add a bed where player sleeps overnight (resets the enemies)
[] Create map bounds
[] lighting
[] Move sounds out of GameState and into it's own sound table where we can allocate with arena based on num variations per sound and stuff.

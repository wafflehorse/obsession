[x] Update RenderQuad struct to remove Rect
[x] Add basic tilemap
[x] Create a base resolution in the game and allow for window resizing that scales quads to the right resolution
[x] Figure out how pixels_per_units actually scales things up and down as screen size changes
	- right now we set the camera size once based on pixels per unit, but we don't update it. We also only set the projection matrix once.
	- So how is tilemap scaling up?
	- And what's interesting, is our ui gets updated with the new pixels per unit each frame and the text seems to stay the same size
	- Revelation: Projection matrix maps our world coordinates to the ndc coords [-1, 1], the viewport stretches those coords to our screen size. 
		- what this means, we set projection and camera once. Then, our internal world units will always scale up correctly with the screen size increasing as long as we update the viewport. 
		- So, we currently have an issue because we update pixels per unit every frame based on the viewport (based on the screen size), but really, the game should never be thinking about pixels per unit really. It should be used to set the camera size, which sets the projection matrix and then scaling happens automatically by the viewport. 

[x] Remove pixels per unit from ui.cpp (viewport should handle the scaling)
	- Although, with fonts, we might be able to cheat a bit and use smaller fonts than our simulated resolution?
[x] Remove screen_size from camera size. Camera size should be based on base resolution
[x] bash script to output pngs from aseprite file
[x] implment bitmap packer with stb_rect_pack
[x] Add bitmap trimming to packer
[x] Add token split function to waffle_lib.h
[x] Add w_to_uppercase function
[x] Add sort algorithm (just ended up using qsort)
[x] Maybe rename the ase_packer tool as its contains the following tools
	- Aseprite export bash script
	- bitmap packer
	- will eventually construct sprite and animations into a header file
[x] Finish up Asepacker tool
[x] Update w_str_length to w_str_len
[x] Figure out how to manage aseprite file with sprite atlas in it
	- Need to somehow label and extract individual bmps
	- Just using slices and a separate aseprite cli call
[x] import basic tileset from stranded
[x] Render basic tileset
[x] Create player entity w/ animation
[x] Add player input
[x] Add player movement
[x] Handle movement animations
[x] Fix player idle flip handling
[x] Fix typing issues around sprite id and animation id
    - Had to separate sprite_assets.h into asset_ids.h and asset_tables.h
[x] Add gamepad support
[x] Get LSP working for gd and autocorrect
[x] Get entity management working, lookups, ids, etc.
	- What if we free an entity in the entity loop, which causes us to move the last entity to that position,
	which would mean that entity would not get updated?
		- What if we instead had the loop operate on ids? Would that change anything?
[x] Add z_indexing to render groups and entities

[x] Delete gun entity if owner is no longer active
[x] Add camera movement with player
[x] Fix player aiming now that camera moves around
[x] Add collision to blocks
	[x] Add block entity
[x] Add z value for representing how far off the ground something is. Like the player gun
[x] Update z-index based on entity y position (player should render correctly in front of and behind blocks)
[x] Fix player collision with warrior so that they don't stick to one another (they exceed collision attempts so they don't end up moving normally)
[x] Add generic entity movement animation update function
[x] Add food
	- This could be some of the animals in the sprite pack?
	- Maybe there are plants or something that we can also use? 
	- Let's go with the boar
	[x] Add boar sprites and animations
	[x] Add boar entity
	[x] Add boar brain
	[x] Add boar meat entity
	[x] Add boar food drops
		[x] Add item concept
		[x] Add item pickup

[x] Populate hot bar with pick up
[x] Move gun to hot bar entity
[x] Add entity rendering based on active hot bar item
[x] Add keyboard controls to switch hot bar active item
[x] Add max width option to container element
[x] Fix hot bar moving with camera lag and screen shake
	- Fixed screen position (nothing to do with camera)
		- although, rendering pipeline assumes world coordinates
[x] Add entity item drops
[x] Add entity item drop velocity and gravity so that it shoots out of entity
[x] Add dead AI state
	[x] Fix warrior animation (stop velocity)
[x] Add boar death animation
	- Can take hunter death animation and remove the hunter on the animal
[x] Add absolute positioning option to elements
[x] Add stacking in hot bar
[x] Add rendering of non-persisted active item
[x] Add handling for when hot bar is full (items don't pull towards player and player doesn't end up picking them up)
[x] Add window on game_memory containing both logical window size and pixel window size
    - this fixes window resizing to work correctly.
[x] Adds animation play flag that allows animation to override a locked animation
    - Fixes warrior not showing death animation when killed in attack animation
[x] Allow non-integer font scaling.
    - This is a little bit of a hack to get text small enough for ui elements like stack size
    - It looks good enough for now
[x] Support dropping stacks
[x] Support picking up stacks
[x] Put generated bitmaps in separate directory so that it can be removed and regenerated without wiping other bitmaps
[x] Fix ore aseprite file uses anim stuff since it breaks them into frames
	- Add maybe _frames.aseprite file handling that treates it as a sprite sheet 
[x] Fix issue where AI entities collide with blocker causing them to be stuck in the wandering state
	- Since they can never reach their target, they stay stuck there
	- With path finding this will be less of an issue, but what if we choose a wander target that is out of bounds or within a blocking entity
		- We probably want some sort of check that the wander target is valid? That might be expensive?
	- Another issue this had me notice was that the animation will be the idle animation since it's not moving
		- And I wonder if that means it's better to have the animation state based on the AI_STATE and we can flip based on velocity?
	- I just added a timer so they don't get stuck
[x] Make animation based on AI state rather than velocity
[x] Simplify animation logic by forcing all animations with a direction to face left
[x] Add player health UI
[x] Fix player damage from warrior
	- hitbox collides on every frame
	- Can maybe solve this by assigning the attack an id (entities can have an attack_id) and use the same collision rule hash
	- Can decide on MAX_ATTACK_IDS which just have to be greater than the max entity id
[x] Pull entity code into entity.cpp
[] Add reset on death
[] Add player brain
[] Add item consumption
[] Randomly spawn enemies around the map
[] Add mech entity
[] Add mech AI
	- How should the player control the mech?
[] Add workbench

[] Add centering to container elements (centering children)
[] Add support for sprite scaling
[] Add boar sleeping
[] Add ground pivots to spritesheet aseprite file types (non animation)
	- Can hopefully use the pivot value on the same slices that define the bitmap
	- Then we just need to add the parsing of sprite sheet aseprite json files to pack.cpp
[] Add pathfinding to player when in range
[] Add a bed where player sleeps overnight (resets the enemies)
[] Create map bounds
[] lighting
[] Move sounds out of GameState and into it's own sound table where we can allocate with arena based on num variations per sound and stuff.
